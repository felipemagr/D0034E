    "# Lab 1: Logical Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will learn how to use propositional logic and knowledge bases to create a simple agent to traverse the Wumpus World.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lab includes:\n",
    "- Implementing a way to create propositional logic sentences.\n",
    "- Implementing a function that, given the values of the variables, evaluates the truth-value of a logic sentence.\n",
    "- Implementing a function that takes a query sentence and checks its truth-value in a given knowledge base by testing all possible models in that knowledge base.\n",
    "- Implementing an agent with a knowledge base of the Wumpus World, can query that knowledge base for which tiles are safe to visit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The content of this lab relates strongly to the material of Chapter 6 (Logical Agents) in the course book (Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach).\n",
    "The enviornment we will tackle in this lab is called the Wumpus World and is covered in the course book as well (Chapter 6.2)"

    "# Making Propositional Logic\n",
    "Before we get started with making an AI for the Wumpus World agent, we need to implement propositional logic which will be the foundation of our AI.\n",
    "Initially it might seem strange to implement propositional logic, since python already has it implemented in the simple ```not```, ```and```, ```or```, and ```==``` operators (implication can be derived from these as well).\n",
    "While its true that any propositional logic statement can be evaluated using Python, these statements cannot be stored in their unevaluated form (which is desirable to form a knowledge base).\n",
    "Additionally, we cannot create variables without assigning them value in standard Python, but when we later want to iterate over all possible models the variables will need to take on many possible values.\n",
    "Take the sentence ```a and b <=> c``` for example, we could write it in Python as ```(a and b) == c```, but we cannot store it and then simply retrieve it again in its original form.\n",
    "And what if we don't know the values of ```a```, ```b```, and ```c``` to begin with (then it would give an error) and then later learn that ```b``` is False.\n",
    "Python's standard implementation cannot deal with this.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So we will need to implement our own version of propositional logic in Python.\n",
    "For variables we will use strings to represent them and later we can use dictionaries to represent models and then look up the value of each variable in that model.\n",
    "For True and False we will simply use the existing ```True``` and ```False``` values in Python.\n",
    "For all the operators we will implement classes that contain the logic sentences they operate on.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin with we have given you a skeleton for a class for the \"and\" operator which you need to complete and then make additional classes for all the other operators. For each class you need to implement ```__init__()``` to store the sub-sentences, ```__eq__()``` to check if two sentences are duplicates, and ```__repr__()``` to make a nice string representation of the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An additional option you might want to add is how to deal with repeated use of the same operation over multiple sentences.\n",
    "If you wish you can implement a function that given a binary operator and a list of sentences chains them togehter (e.g. ```fun(And, [s1, s2, s3]) -> And(S1, And(s2, s3))```).\n",
    "Another option is to allow your binary operators to take any number of inputs directly (e.g. ```And(s1, s2, s3)```).\n",
    "In the latter case you will need to think about how to deal with the ```evaluation``` function in the next code block."

    "\n",
    "Being able to form sentences in propositional logic is not very useful if we cannot actually evaluate them.\n",
    "For this we will implement a fuction ```evaluate``` that takes a sentence in propositional logic and a dictonary with the truth values of the different variables in a given model and returns the truth value of the sentence in that model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the standard propositional logic we will add a new thing to the mix to make evaluation of large models more efficient down the line.\n",
    "The thing we will add is the concept of an unknown or uninteresting truth value using the Python ```None```-type.\n",
    "The idea with unknown values is that instead of iterating over every value for every variable to evaluate a model, we can decide to only iterate over some variables and set the others as unknown.\n",
    "However if an important variable is set to unknown we might not be able to get the correct answer.\n",
    "In order to protect against this the ```evaluate``` function will return ```True``` if the sentence is true, ```False``` if its false, and ```None``` if we cannot know since some variables are unknown to us.\n",
    "In order to deal with the ```None``` values you will have to think what the answer to many different operators should be. For example, we know that ```And(False, None)``` should be ```False``` since ```And``` always returns ```False``` when at least one sub-sentence is ```False```.\n",
    "You will also need to experiment with Python to see if the Python operators give the correct behavior. Does ```False == None``` return ```None```.\n",
    "If not, how to deal with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A start of the function can be found below, but it is missing most things.\n",
    "Additionally, the function for replacing the variables with their correct truth-value will currently give an error if a variable is missing, but we want it to return ```None``` to represent an unknown value instead."

    "## Querying for possible models from a Knowledge Base\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we'll get to creating and dealing with knowledge bases.\n",
    "Making a knowledge base is not that difficult, it's simply a collection of logical sentences that are known (or presumed) to be true in a given environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create this collection we will use the Python ```set``` data structure.\n",
    "The reason is that sets can only contain one of each element so we don't risk adding the same sentence multiple times.\n",
    "Sets can be created by listing  a number of elements in curly brackets (```{}```), and elements can be added and removed with the ```.add()``` and ```.remove()``` functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more difficult part is then creating a function for querying the knowledge base for whether a new sentence is true or not.\n",
    "One simple way to do this query is to test every possible model (every possible combination of truth values for the variables).\n",
    "For each model we figure out whether the query sentence is True or False, we then also check that all sentences in the knowledge base are True for that model.\n",
    "Since we \"know\" that each sentence in the knowledge base should be true, any model that doesn't align with this can be discarded as an \"invalid\" model of our environment.\n",
    "For all \"valid\" models we then return whether that model is True or False.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course many environments have a huge amount of variables which would then require us to check a huge number of models.\n",
    "If we have $n$ variables in the environment we would need to check each sentence $n^2$ times.\n",
    "However,  not every variable is necessarily relevant for our query sentence.\n",
    "In the Wumpus World, for example, if there is a WUMPUS at [2,3] has no impact on whether there is a PIT at [1,1].\n",
    "Using our knowledge of the environment we might be able to deduce the minimum number of variables that are relevant for our query and only test all combinations of them.\n",
    "This is why we implemented the concept of unknown (```None```) values earlier.\n",
    "Due to this we also consider a model \"valid\" if sentence in the knowledge base evaluate as unknown.\n",
    "This comes with a risk of course, if we mistakenly exclude a relevant variable in our query a model that should be \"invalid\" might be considered \"valid\" since a False evaluation might now be unknown.\n",
    "Additionally, we need to return all \"valid\" models that are unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then use this query function to figure things about the environment.\n",
    "If a query sentence only gives \"valid\" models in which it is True, then we know the sentence is True in the environment.\n",
    "Conversely, if all returned models are False, the sentence is False in the environment.\n",
    "If it returns some True models and some False models we know that, given what we know of the environment we cannot yet tell whether the sentence is True or not (in some advanced scenarios we might be able to use the number of True/False models to estimate the likelihood of the query being True/False in the actual environment).\n",
    "If some of the returned models are unknown models, we know that there are relevant variables that were not considered in the query.\n",
    "This likely means we have an error in the code that determines which variables should be relevant for a query.\n",
    "Note that many variables that are not in the query sentence could still be relevant.\n",
    "For example, if we query whether there is a PIT at [0,1] it is relevant if there is a breeze at [0,0].\n",
    "Finally, if the function returns no valid models at all, this means that there are contradictions in the knowledge base and something has gone wrong in its construction.\n",
